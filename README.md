# Alarm-Clock
This is a simple alarm program. The user is asked to input the time and when the time reaches, the web browser is opened and a link is opened (a youtube video in this case)
We store the youtube links in a text file called as links.txt. A random link is selected from the links.txt and is opened in your default web browser.
